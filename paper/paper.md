# 1.Introduction
Meanwhile there are many different programming languages. These differ in their concepts. Depending on what is to be implemented, one of them is used. For example, there are concepts of distributed programming, functional programming or object-oriented programming. This paper compares the concepts of object-oriented programming in the programming languages GO and Swift.

The following chapter explains the concept of object-oriented programming in general. It then goes on to explain the basics of this object-oriented programming, how it can be depicted in diagrams and what the most important features of this are.

In the following two chapters, the concept of object-oriented programming in Go and Swift is explained. Here, the features explained in chapter 2 are used as a guide.

In the last chapter of this thesis, the differences between the programming languages Go and Swift are explained in relation to object-oriented programming.

# 2.Koncept of Object Oriented Programming
## 2.1Concept
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm of imperative programming. By encapsulating data and code in objects, the problem to be solved is worked out step by step. With OOP, a higher degree of abstraction is thus achieved through modularisation into objects than, for example, through a procedural programming language. Because of the encapsulation, the objects can be checked and tested independently of other parts of the programme. By encapsulating the variables in the objects, they can only be changed by the respective methods. This ensures that the variables of the object are not influenced by other parts of the programme.

Object-oriented programming not only saves time because the code does not have to be written and adapted repeatedly, it also avoids copy-and-paste errors that occur during adaptation. Above all, through the inheritance of class-based languages, the basic code does not change through the original class and this makes it easier to implement new classes more quickly. Additionally it avoids to rewrite already existing methods a second time.

## 2.2Characteristics
### Objects
Objects have attributes that have a certain state at a certain time. The state of the variables can be changed by methods to obtain expected values for the object.
### Classes
Classes are the blueprint for the objects. They are used to manage similar objects such as a car. Cars have the same characteristics, but their properties such as make, colour, model or age can be different. Thus, the class would be the blueprint for objects of cars.
### Inheritance
Objects and classes share common properties in object-oriented programming according to the concept of inheritance. Superclasses inherit the properties they possess to subclasses. For example, a car is the subclass of vehicles, whereas a motorbike is also a subclass of vehicles. Since vehicles share properties such as colour, brand or mileage. This also additionally reduces the programming effort. For example, methods for determining the kilometre reading can already be implemented in the superclass Vehicle and do not have to be implemented again in the subclass.  [] 
### Polymorphism
Thanks to polymorphisation, methods can be overwritten. This means that in subclasses, methods with the same names of the superclass can be adapted specifically to the subclass. In addition, polymorphism allows object variables of the superclass to take on the object variables of the subclass. 
### Generalization
In object-oriented programming, generalisation is used to bundle classes and objects with common properties and methods into one logical unit.
